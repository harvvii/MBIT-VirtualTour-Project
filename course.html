    <h1>Departments</h1>
    <p><b>MBIT have Three Departments with excellent staff and fully equiped laboratories and classrooms.</b></p>

 <div class="row">
     <div class="course-col">
       <h3>Computer Engineering</h3>
    <p>The Department of Computer Engineering at Madhuben & Bhanubhai Patel Institute of Technology, offers four year degree program to 
        undergrad students. The quality of life has improved significantly with advent of computers. PC, Laptop, cell phones, Internet and
         Teleconference have become household commodities. The Computer Department has been established in 2009. Since its inception, the 
         department is dedicated to education, research and overall excellence providing a superior teaching environment for its students to 
         flourish in different domains of Computers.
         Computer Engineering department has always performed brilliantly in academics and holds a proud position among all departments.</p>
   </div>
   
<div class="course-col">
<h3>Information Technology Engineering</h3>
<p>The Department of Information Technology at offers four year degree program in Bachelors of Engineering. Information Technology is 
about learning and understanding the mathematical, scientific and engineering principles underlying every kind of Information system,
 from mobile phones and the internet, via systems that interpret natural language, to the supercomputers that forecast tomorrow’s weather
  or simulate the effects of disease on the human heart. Information Technology encompasses wide range of technologies such as television 
  and telephones. Several industries are associated with information technology, 
including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, e-commerce and computer services.</p>
</div>


<div class="course-col">
<h3>Applied Science & Humanities</h3>
<p>Applied Science and Humanities is dedicated to lay the foundation of a student in the fundamental sciences and basic humanities like 
Physics, Chemistry, Environmental Studies, and Professional Communication. The well-equipped laboratories and rich curriculum 
provide ample opportunities to budding engineers to have hands-on experience of laws and facts of science and develop and inculcate 
scientific attitude among them. A sapient and skilled plethora of faculty members. Consistent and exceptional academic excellence 
in terms of results. Mentoring and monitoring of the students for holistic development.</p>

<section class="course">
    <h1>Other Departments</h1>
    <p><b>MBIT have other departments which are important for students overall development.</b></p>

 <div class="row">
     <div class="course-col">
       <h3>Physics</h3>
    <p>Physics is the mother of all sciences. The role of physics in engineering education is not static one. It must respond and evolve with the momentous changes in both engineering and physics which are occurring continually. The predominant reliance of early engineering upon art is giving way to a modern technology based squarely upon the physical sciences. Physics is a study of energy, matter, and their interactions. It plays an important role in the future progress of the humankind. It is important to study physics at school and engineering level for those who have the ambition to be at the front position of enhancing technologies and theories that explains our reality. It provides the students with problem solving, analytical, and quantitative abilities. All the activities in our daily life involve the application of physics.</p>
   </div>
   
<div class="course-col">
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p>Mathematics is one of the most important subjects which enhance the ability of analytical and rational thinking. It is common belief that mathematics is a dry and difficult subject on the contrary if it is presented in a systematic and illustrative manner it becomes much easier for even beginner to understand and appreciate it.  All branches of engineering, technology and science require mathematics as a tool for the description of their contents.  Therefore through knowledge of various topics in mathematics is essential to pursue courses in these fields.</p>
</div>


<div class="course-col">
<h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>
<p>Mechanical Engineering is an engineering discipline that involves application of principles of analysis, design, manufacturing and maintenance. It is one of the oldest and most essential branches of engineering.  Mechanical Engineering strives to disseminate technical knowledge to its undergraduate students to meet intellectual and career challenges for sustainable growth of humanity.</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="row">
    <div class="course-col">
      <h3>Management</h3>
   <p>The world is changing; with the challenges facing us on a global level there is a new need for companies and organizations to integrate technical and business skills to solve these difficult problems. In the complex, competitive world of technology driven industry, skilled engineers who understand the essential principles of business and law have a tremendous competitive advantage. Therefore every engineering student must study economics and management subject at undergraduate level.</p>
  </div>
  
<div class="course-col">
<h3>Communication Skills</h3>
<p>It is now accepted worldwide that Communication is an indispensable facet of life. Appropriate communication skills are a must for a successful professional as well as personal life. Whatever may be one’s field, competence in communication creates path for the victory. Thus, good communication skills are a prerequisite for every engineer and such a professional can be an asset to any organization.</p>
</div>


<div class="course-col">
<h3>Professional Development</h3>
<p>The Department of Professional Development understand the need of current competitive scenario therefore run separate certification programs like CCNA Certification, Oracle Certification, GATE Preparation Classes etc. Department of Professional Development also emphasize on improving inter personal skills of students and helps students of improve in each domain.
The Department of Professional Development additionally help students in enhancing skills through offering testing frameworks for aptitude, programming and communication. The Department is empowering students to acquire the knowledge, skills, and self-confidence.</p>
